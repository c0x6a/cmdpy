cmdpy
=====

A very very very dumb terminal emulator, made with Flask.

Inspired by someone commenting in a Python group on Telegram about
sending commands to the O.S. terminal using python.


Installation:
-------------

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

  pip install -U -r requeriments.txt


Run:
----

Simply run:

  python cmdpy.py

and go to your broswer with the link showed in the console (usually
`127.0.0.1:5000 <http://127.0.0.1:5000>`_).

There is also an *nginx* configuration file if you want to serve it
using **nginx**.
